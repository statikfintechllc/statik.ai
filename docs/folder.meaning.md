# SDF.RETYE.AF.master

Means:
- SDF: Source Docs Folder
- RETYE: Read Every Time You Edit
- AF: Any File
- master: Master Copy

## Repo Folder Semantics & Required Procedures

**Purpose:** Clear, human-readable intent for each top-level folder and machine-enforceable rules to keep docs and code aligned.

**Folder map:**
- `src/` — Implementation. All changes that affect behavior must include tests and a reference to the corresponding `docs/SDF.RETYE.AF.master/*` file(s).
- `docs/SDF.RETYE.AF.master/` — Authoritative source of truth (**Read Every Time You Edit**). Any PR touching behavior must reference the docs consulted and include documentation updates where appropriate.
- `tests/` — Executable specs (unit/integration/e2e). Tests are required before merging functional changes.
- `scripts/` — Reproducible build and CI helper scripts (Dockerfile, SBOM, attestation scripts).
- `bootstrap/`, `schemas/`, `assets/` — Operational and data artifacts. Changes to these directories MUST be mapped to the matching `docs/SDF.RETYE.AF.master/*` file(s). The repository contains `docs/sdf-index.yaml` (autogenerated + overrides) which maps repo paths → SDF docs and validations.
- `.github/` — CI configuration and PR templates; governs automated enforcement.

**Procedures & Governance:**
- **Read-every-time rule:** When editing a file that affects behavior, you MUST read the corresponding `docs/SDF.RETYE.AF.master/*` file(s) and either update them or add a clear PR note explaining why a doc change was not required. This is enforced by the `docs-check` CI job.
- **Pre-edit checklist (local):** run tests, run linter, ensure docs referenced or updated, add/update tests as needed.
- **Gating:** CI must pass; for `autonomy-` changes require the `autonomy-change` label, two human approvals (including one security/infra reviewer), and a documented risk assessment in the PR.
- **Production release:** Reproducible build (lockfile + Docker build) + SBOM + SLSA attestation + signed release tag.

**Index & Mapping:**
- The repository maintains `docs/sdf-index.yaml` which maps repository paths (globs) to authoritative SDF doc files and recommended validations. This file is autogenerated by `scripts/generate-sdf-index.js` and supports manual `overrides:` for edge cases. When adding new files, ensure `sdf-index` maps the new files to the appropriate SDF docs.

**Enforcement & Exceptions:**
- The `docs-check` CI job will fail for PRs that touch files without matching SDF docs or without the required doc signoff/updates.
- For emergency or low-risk changes, include an `emergency` tag and a short justification; these must be followed by a post-merge doc update and an incident note.
